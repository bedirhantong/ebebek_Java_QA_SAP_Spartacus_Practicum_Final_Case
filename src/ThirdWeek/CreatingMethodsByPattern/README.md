# Creating Methods by Pattern

* Write a "Recursive" method in Java language without looping 
  which obeys the following rule based on the n value received from the user.

* Rule : Subtract 5 from the entered number up to where the entered number is 
0 or negative. Print the last value to the screen during each subtraction. 
Add 5 again after the number is negative or 0. Again, print the last value of 
the number on the screen in each addition operation.
